format: openspec-delta/v1
domain: sdd-lifecycle

## ADDED

### Scenario: explicit-sdd-startup-bootstraps-config-and-enters-scope
title: Explicit SDD startup creates or preserves configuration before scope
requirement: The system MUST create missing OpenSpec configuration during an explicit SDD request, MUST preserve the exact existing `openspec/config.yaml` bytes when configuration already exists, and MUST continue the original request to `sdd-scope` without requiring manual initialization.
Given: a user explicitly requests SDD and `openspec/config.yaml` is either absent or already contains user-provided bytes.
When: SDD startup preparation completes.
Then: a missing configuration is created, existing configuration bytes are unchanged, and the original request continues to `sdd-scope` without requiring `/sdd-init`, a repeated request, or a separate initialization confirmation.

### Scenario: early-phase-status-distinguishes-pending-artifacts-from-blockers
title: Status suppresses only future task absence during early phases
requirement: The system MUST treat absent `tasks.md` as pending work rather than a blocker while the recommended phase is scope, map, or design, and MUST surface actionable task, apply, and verify blockers once their downstream phases are reached.
Given: an SDD change is in an early phase without `tasks.md`, or has reached tasks, apply, or verify with an actionable artifact problem.
When: lifecycle status or next-step diagnostics are resolved.
Then: early-phase diagnostics do not report absent `tasks.md` as a blocker, while absent, unreadable, malformed, or blocked tasks and incomplete or blocked apply and failed or unknown verify outcomes remain visible at their applicable downstream phases.
