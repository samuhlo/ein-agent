# OpenSpec Delta
format: openspec-delta/v1
domain: sdd-lifecycle

## ADDED
### Scenario: forced-close-preserves-readiness-gates
title: Forced close cannot archive incomplete or unverified work
requirement: The system MUST preserve task, apply, verify, summary, and canonical-spec readiness gates when forced close is requested and MUST NOT archive a change with pending tasks, incomplete apply, missing, failing, or stale verify evidence, missing or stale summary evidence, or an OpenSpec conflict.
Given: an SDD change is not fully close-ready because one or more required lifecycle conditions are incomplete, absent, failing, stale, or conflicted.
When: close is requested with force enabled.
Then: the change remains active, every applicable blocker is reported, and force does not classify or archive the change as complete.

### Scenario: forced-close-explicit-legacy-escape
title: Declarationless unresolved legacy close is narrow and auditable
requirement: The system MUST allow forced close only for an unresolved spec state caused solely by the declarationless legacy record shape after all non-spec close-readiness gates pass, and MUST distinguish that result from normal close by returning legacy escape evidence and a non-empty valid reason.
Given: a canonical legacy SDD change has an unresolved state caused solely by a readable declarationless scope, no delta document, no sync-report.md, all non-spec close-readiness gates pass, and the caller explicitly supplies force and a valid audit reason.
When: forced close readiness and archival are evaluated.
Then: the system may archive through the legacy escape, returns distinguishable legacy evidence with the reason without reclassifying or synchronizing the unresolved state, and does not weaken normal close or admit incomplete modern changes.

## MODIFIED
### Scenario: canonical-close-readiness
title: Canonical close readiness requires synchronized evidence except for one declarationless legacy escape
requirement: The system MUST block close when canonical spec evidence is unresolved, pending, malformed, stale, or conflicted, except that force MAY admit only an unresolved declarationless legacy record after all non-spec close gates pass and a valid audit reason is supplied; assessment and close MUST NOT synchronize or rewrite specs.
Given: a canonical SDD change has otherwise passing task, apply, verify, summary, naming, source, and archive-destination gates, while its canonical spec evidence is synchronized, pending, conflicted, malformed, stale, or unresolved.
When: close readiness is evaluated normally or with force and an audit reason.
Then: normal close requires synchronized evidence; pending, conflict, malformed, and stale evidence always blocks; only the exact unresolved declarationless legacy shape may close with force and a valid reason, returning distinguishable legacy evidence without reclassifying or synchronizing the spec state.
