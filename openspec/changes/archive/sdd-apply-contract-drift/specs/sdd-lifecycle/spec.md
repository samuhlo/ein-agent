# OpenSpec Delta
format: openspec-delta/v1
domain: sdd-lifecycle

## ADDED
### Scenario: apply-default-acceptance-none
title: Normal apply does not require an acceptance report
requirement: The system MUST inject `acceptance: none` for normal apply work and MUST NOT require or claim an acceptance report for that mode, while preserving the independent `sdd-verify` final gate.
Given: an SDD change enters normal or mechanical apply work without an explicit verified override.
When: the apply contract and runtime handoff are evaluated.
Then: acceptance is none, no acceptance report is required, and the change still proceeds to independent sdd-verify.

### Scenario: apply-explicit-verified-override
title: Verified apply remains an evidence-bearing exception
requirement: The system MUST treat `acceptance: verified` as an explicit exceptional override and MUST require fresh re-execution and evidence for that mode.
Given: an apply request explicitly selects the verified acceptance override.
When: apply completion is assessed.
Then: completion requires the specified checks to be re-executed and their evidence recorded; the normal acceptance-none default does not satisfy the override.
